# Cubic-Interpolation

If the values of a function f(x) and its derivative are known at x=0 and x=1, then the function can be interpolated on the interval [0,1] using a third degree polynomial. This is called cubic interpolation.

From your side, you have to set your function, intervals, iteration amount, and permissible error.
